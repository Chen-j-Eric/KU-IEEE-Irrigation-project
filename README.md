# KU-IEEE-Irrigation-project
This is the place where we will post/edit the code for our IEEE project.
The code should be written in Arduino IDE version 2.3.6, Using ESP-32 plugin from Espressif 3.3.2. 

# Meetings
Thursdays from 5:00PM - 6PM LEEP 132X

# Parts List
- Freenove ESP32 Board
- 12" Watering Plant Container with Drainage Hole
- 4PC DC Motor
- 5V Relay | 4 Channel
- Gravity: IP65 Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
- 5 Herb Seeds Variety Kit 

# Freenove ESP32 Board
Because the Freenove is not as popular as some other ESP32s, You will have to compile and run it like a generic ESP32 dev board.
On linux(Fedora 42), you may have to give the your board/Usb sudo or R+W permissions
