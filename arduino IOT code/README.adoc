. Create an account at https://cloud.arduino.cc/
. Connect your ESP32 using the official guide:
  https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/guides/esp32/
. Create your variables:
  https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/variables/
. Set up your dashboard:
  https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/dashboard-widgets/

NOTE:  
If you are having issues, it is likely that your dashboard variables do not match the ones in the code.  
Replace them with the ones you have created, or rename them to match the code exactly.
